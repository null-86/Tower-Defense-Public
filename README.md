# Tower-Defense-Public
Summary:
This is a simple tower defense game made in Unity, and it's the oldest project that I'm willing to make public. Enemies/objects move toward the player's base and deal damage. 
The game ends when your base runs out of health.

Issues:
Tight coupling made code maintenance a nightmare. I also failed to plan for UX, so the game "feels" bad even though the actual mechanics technically work. Menu Navigation (may not even be present in this version)
was rudimentary.

Lessons learned:
Focus more on abstracting my code into sensible interfaces. Plan the UX from the start as it's crucial.
